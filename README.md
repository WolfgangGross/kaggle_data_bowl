In This folder id like to collect the files needed for my experimentation on the Data Bowl

see Kaggle -> LINK

Files:
train.py 
-is the Demo file to get stated here the data ges loaded and the data strukture is made

reservoir.py
-here is tried to implement the reservoir coputing for the matlab file; but the two file
res_demo_plain.py
and 
res_demo_oger.py 
already did that. They need the .TXT MackeyGlass_t17 file to work.

TO DO:
=============

* Generate additional features out of the data and add them to the data structure
	- e.g. the traice stuff from Renato
* DONE ---Create I/O helper to generate the output .csv file for uploading on Kaggle
* DONE ---Install ESM as calssifier
	- use demo to get started
	- manipulate the code to work on the data
	- use engine to validate perfomance
* (Make flag for small Data set)
* DONE ---- Save data vector X as file when not working in the feature extraction
=============
* Cross Validation for Reservoir
* Run Reservoir on Test Data
* 
============
install cxxnet and GPU programming
